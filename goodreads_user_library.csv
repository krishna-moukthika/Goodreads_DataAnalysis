This book has left me in a riot of emotions, throughout the story. The story can be summarized into a single word. It’s about POWER. The author shows the want, need and greed for the power that drives people to chase their dreams.<br/><br/>What may have started as an honest need to control one’s fate turns into a deadly and ruinous game for power. The story takes you through the life of three generations of the MacGregor/Blackwell family. You may start reading book that this book would have the villain, a lead, and a happy ending. Fair warning, if that is what you are in for then this is not for you. Kate was manipulative, ambitious, determined, conniving and smart and made the story all the more interesting with her machinations.<br/><br/><i>I am the past. He is the future. My great-grandson will take over Kruger-Brent Limited one day.</i><br/><br/>What I liked most in this story was that, this book was not biased towards anyone. Most of the books that I read have a distinct tone of the author, little remarks that make you like some particular characters and dislike some. This book does no such thing. You are given the story as facts, given a glimpse of their thoughts so you could form your own opinion about them. I finished this book in just a day. It was hard to keep my eye off the story, even for a second. So far I’ve read only two books of his but I’ve thoroughly enjoyed his writing as well as the fast-paced stories that he writes.<br/><br/>The foundation of Kruger-Brent and the journey that made the company and the family a power to reckon with is adventurous. The twists and turns would catch you off guard with the frequency with which they appear. It was an emotionally draining experience, and there were some moments where I wished the story would come to a quick end. But, I feel that the length of the story is justified as you get a deeper understanding of human nature and the lengths to which they go to get what they want.<br/><br/>I expected a dramatic ending where all the wrongs are righted or at least the people wronged are justified. The actual ending was more satisfying. This was such a delight and made me wonder why I’ve never picked his books. If you haven’t read it yet, I would definitely recommend you to pick it up.",,,1,0

Vanja, a 16 year old has been impersonating the Princess Gisele for over an year now. She has it all figured out but her fortune quickly proves to be tricky thing. She has little time to decide whether she chooses to serve either of her Godmothers: Fortune or Death. To make matters worse, she is being hunted and her impersonation of the princess seems to be coming to an end. What she does to get out of this seemingly impossible situation and loveable characters makes this story very engaging. Vanja is one of my favourite anti-hero main characters. Her selfishness, fears, and desires are something so painfully real that I fell in love with her character. I was angry and sad on her behalf. The writing was easy to follow with an interesting world building. I read this book in one sitting. All the characters were well developed with Emeric and Ragne being my favourite. The romance was so cute but I did wish to see more angst but this story was not just about romance anyway.

This was a character driven story so there was little action and plot development. It was mostly focused on Emilia and Wrath's relationship. It was described as being spicier but it was mild at best. Their chemistry was sorely lacking and I couldn't enjoy their interactions. I saw the huge twists from a mile away. The writing was certainly not bad but the story was neither bad nor good. Just bland. And as in the first book, the descriptions felt incomplete and difficult to visualise. Maybe I'm being too critical but I was disappointed.

I'm always intrigued with a vampire story. I didn't have any high expectations going in and that proved to be for the best. The plot isn't the most original but managed to hook me in. This was told through dual POVs - Elise and Claire. In the beginning it was difficult to distinguish between them as their characters felt so similar. The whole time I was reading this, I felt that this was the beginning of a series. There was inadequate information about the Veil, the powers of the Death Oracle and in general the development of the characters. There were some diverse characters but they fell flat. Elise's  ' best friends ' didn't have any major role in the story. Their only purpose was to appear conveniently for a plot twist or to move the story along. I didn't find any strong evidence supporting their close friendship. Claire had the potential to be a complex character but felt like the female version of Edward Cullen. The main couple's relationship could have been  fully explored. I expected a forced proximity but slowly fall in love trope but it was straight up insta love. I'm not a fan of that especially if there is no strong reason for their attraction towards each other. I still don't get it why they like each other.

Lot of the conflicts were wrapped up too neatly without us getting a glimpse at the sudden epiphanies the side characters had.

But instead, she's dragged into a competition to resolve her longstanding rivalry with Ian. I always like to read academic rivals to lovers and this book stayed true to this trope. I lived for the banter between Kavya and Ian. Their efforts to one-up each other in tests, reading challenges, and basically, everything was hilarious to read. Apart from the romance, I appreciated reading about the complex family dynamics, friendships and cruel taunts from 'well-meaning' acquaintances that are very frequent in the South Asian community. I was very envious of the moon girls as I wanted to have a group of friends who stood by me when I was young. I could see how smitten Ian was with Kavya that I was internally squealing with joy. My favourite part of the story was the character growth of every character. This made the entire book all the more enjoyable.

The book follows the story of Chandler Cohen, a ghostwriter who attends a book signing for the book she ghostwrote, but unfortunately, the author doesn't recognize her. Feeling dejected, Chandler goes to a nearby bar to try and shake off her disappointment. It is there that she meets a charming man who she ends up having an awkward hookup with and she wants to forget the hookup and move on.<br/>However, fate has other plans for her. Chandler's next project is ghostwriting a memoir for Finn Walsh, a C-list actor known for his role on a werewolf show. To Chandler's surprise, Finn turns out to be the same guy she had the one-night stand with. Chandler is determined to keep her partnership with Finn strictly professional, but as they work together more closely, their relationship starts to change. They must figure out what is more important: business or pleasure.<br/>This is a sweet romance that has one of the healthiest romantic relationships I've ever read. The character development is fantastic, and I loved how Chandler and Finn communicated their issues in a mature and respectful manner. Finn's sincerity and determination to improve his bedroom skills was also a refreshing change from the typical alpha-male characters in romance novels.<br/>The pacing of the story was the only downside for me. At times, it felt quite slow, and I wanted more action to keep me engaged. Despite this minor flaw, Business or Pleasure is an adorable romance that I would recommend to readers who enjoy slow romances with refreshing main characters.<br/>Overall, Rachel Lynn Solomon has done an excellent job of creating a heartwarming romance that will keep you hooked from start to finish. The unique storyline, fantastic character development, and healthy romantic relationship make Business or Pleasure a must-read for all romance fans.",,,1,0

As a fan of the author's previous works, I was thrilled to delve into this book and discover what kind of mischief the beloved aunties and their favorite young couple were up to this time around.<br/><br/>From the very first page, I was captivated. The chemistry between Benjamin ""Bunty"" Padda and Bobbi Kaur leaped off the page, and their witty banter had me grinning from ear to ear. As they joined forces to plan Prem and Kareena's wedding and hunt down the Shaadi saboteur, I found myself becoming increasingly invested in their journey.<br/><br/>One of the things I admire most about Nisha Sharma's writing is her ability to depict the complexities of family dynamics. In Tastes Like Shakkar, she explores toxic family relationships and the pressures of being the eldest child in a way that is both authentic and empathetic. And, of course, the meddling aunties added their unique brand of chaos to the mix, resulting in some truly hilarious scenes.<br/><br/>However, the true highlight for me was the romance. Without giving too much away, I must say that the steamy scenes in this book were perfect. I also appreciated how the author tackled issues such as cultural identity and expectations in a manner that felt natural to the story and characters.<br/><br/>Overall, I cherished Tastes Like Shakkar. Nisha Sharma has a remarkable talent for blending comedy, romance, and mystery into a delectable treat that left me feeling both fulfilled and eager for more.

As a young adult debut, it radiates charm and captivates you from start to finish. The story revolves around two ex-best friends who suddenly find themselves in fierce competition for the prestigious titles of high school valedictorian and the accompanying scholarship. Determined to settle the score, they make a daring bet—a best-of-three challenge where the winner takes it all.<br/><br/>This academic rivals-to-lovers tale is one of the best I've ever read. Ezra is an absolute sweetheart. His endearing nature and his flirtatious interactions with Sasha had me grinning like a fool throughout the book. Their chemistry was simply too adorable to resist. On the other hand, Sasha, with her ambitious plan and the weight of her tie with Ezra as an obstacle, resonated with me deeply. I empathized with her fear of disappointing her mom, but I was relieved to see that she had a strong support system in her best friends, Pricilla and Chance. Their bond was an absolute delight to witness, and it made me appreciate their friendship even more.<br/><br/>While I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I couldn't help but wish for a deeper exploration of Ezra and Sasha's past as best friends and the events that led to their fallout. I believe delving into their history would have added even more depth to their complex relationship. However, despite this, there were countless heartwarming moments shared between them that left me feeling all warm and fuzzy inside. <br/><br/>If you're in the mood for a heartwarming teen romance that will leave you with a smile on your face, You Bet Your Heart is the perfect choice. <br/><br/>Thank you to the publisher for the gifted copy!",,,1,0

The story is centered around the protagonist, Fan Zilan, who dreams of becoming a royal alchemist and providing for her family by creating alchemical gold and gems that the wealthy can consume to stay young forever. However, she is currently trapped in her impoverished village in southern China, forced to practice illegal alchemy to earn a living by resurrecting the dead for a price.<br/><br/>When Zilan gets an opportunity to go to the capital to compete in the imperial exams, she becomes embroiled in dangerous politics. The novel's underlying themes revolve around class differences and how the rich exploit the poor. The author's ability to weave these themes into the story without detracting from the plot is commendable.<br/><br/>One of the main relationships that I enjoyed was between Zilan, Wenshu, and Yufei. The three characters are intertwined in a way that enhances the story's depth and emotional connection. Although I haven't read many stories on alchemy, this is one of the best. The author's portrayal of alchemy is captivating, and it was fascinating to see the various ways in which alchemy was used and often misused by the rich. The love interest, Hong Li, was a refreshing character. Throughout the story, we witness his growth and how he realizes his willful ignorance. His character arc is well-written and adds depth to the story.<br/><br/>The plot had some twists that I didn't see coming, and it managed to capture my attention throughout. The author did an excellent job of building suspense and keeping the pace of the story engaging. The story's darker elements were handled with care and added to the story's overall appeal.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Scarlet Alchemist"" is a solid start to a fantasy duology, and I'm excited to read its sequel. The author's writing style is impeccable, and the story's characters and plot are well-developed. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction or fantasy novels.",,,1,0

It was one of my most anticipated fantasy reads, and it definitely delivered!<br/><br/>This story takes us on a journey inspired by the history of the Philippines. We follow Talasyn and Alaric, bitter enemies with opposing magical abilities, who have been tangled up in the never-ending Hurricane Wars between their rival kingdoms. The author fearlessly explores the brutal aftermath of war and the effects of colonization, which added a powerful layer to the fantasy world. It was brimming with captivating myths and magic that kept me hooked until the very last page. The beginning was a bit rocky with a hefty information dump, but once I got past that, the story took off and didn't let go. The characters in this book really stole the show. The author skillfully explores their motivations and biases, allowing them to grow into better versions of themselves. But the real magic happened between Alaric and Talasyn—the tension between them, that enemies-to-lovers vibe, had me on the edge of my seat. I was constantly wondering when they would betray each other, and it kept me hooked. The ending left me a little disappointed as it didn't have that big climactic moment I was hoping for. However, despite that, I'm still invested in the story and dying to know what happens next.<br/><br/>All in all, The Hurricane Wars by Thea Guanzon is a must-read fantasy with a richly imagined world inspired by Philippine history. Although it had a rocky start and a slightly underwhelming ending, the captivating mythology, well-developed characters, and intense enemies-to-lovers dynamic make it a story worth diving into.<br/>",,,1,0

What a thrilling ride it was, packed with non-stop action! The story kicks off with our main character waking up in Paris, concussed and bewildered, while someone urgently yells, ""Run, Alex. Run!"" From that moment on, we are taken on a roller-coaster journey where numerous mobsters are hot on her trail, and a mysterious man, who might just be a spy.<br/><br/>The revelation that she is the identical twin sister of the spy, Alex, adds an exciting twist to the plot. It was incredibly enjoyable to witness a main character who always manages to miraculously escape from perilous situations. What's even more fun is her consistent comparisons to the clichés found in stories, especially when the hero remains completely clueless about them. The moments when he has to remind her that he was dangerous, like killing someone with a negligee, had me in fits of laughter.<br/><br/>I can easily picture ""The Blonde Identity"" being turned into an exciting movie. If you're in the mood for a hilarious spy thriller, I wholeheartedly recommend picking this book up. Ally Carter's storytelling will keep you entertained from start to finish.<br/>",,,1,0

Henry is a precog who has visions of the future, and he starts having visions of Natalie's murder. They try to understand how their lives are intertwined, with each of them trying to uncover secrets. It was really an interesting premise, but it had a poor execution. The first half was a slog to read, and there was little chemistry between them. A lot of the plot twists felt over the top and predictable. The characters were bland, and it was hard to root for any of them.

However, the catch is that her ex-boyfriend, Elliot Bloom, is the florist hired for the wedding. I was excited to dive into this novel, as I am a fan of second-chance romances, and I was not disappointed by the author's storytelling. One of the things that stood out to me was the author's strong voice, which made it easy to become immersed in the story. The contrast between the two main characters, Ama and Elliot, was also well-portrayed. The story is told through dual points of view, with Ama's present-day perspective and Elliot's flashbacks to their past relationship. This structure allowed me to get a better understanding of their history and the reasons behind their eventual breakup. While the premise was intriguing and the author's writing style was engaging, I did not feel a strong connection between Ama and Elliot. Despite the fact that they were forced to work together on the wedding, I did not sense the tension and chemistry that is usually present in a second-chance romance. Additionally, Elliot's constant reference to Ama's size and his own was distracting and unnecessary, and I found it to be an overused plot device.<br/>Overall, while ""Forget Me Not"" was not the best second-chance romance I've read, I enjoyed Julie Soto's writing style and would be interested in reading any future books she writes.

The author continues to follow Vanja's story, as she journeys to find an honest profession before finding her biological family, all while unintentionally forming a cult. The opening of the book is filled with humour, which sets the tone for the rest of the story. However, soon after, the stakes are raised significantly, leading to a series of engaging quests that will keep you hooked from beginning to end.<br/><br/>One of the most remarkable aspects of the story is the development of Vanja and Emeric's relationship. Their bond is a breath of fresh air, and I appreciated how they shared their feelings, fears, and insecurities with one another. It was beautiful to see them grow together and support each other throughout the story. While there were many familiar characters from the first book, there were also many new ones. Unfortunately, I found it a bit overwhelming at times, and I struggled to keep up with all the new introductions.<br/><br/>Although the middle of the story did drag a bit due to the numerous quests, it still managed to hold my attention, and I found it to be thoroughly entertaining. One of the key elements that I particularly enjoyed was learning about Vanja's childhood through the little tidbits of information scattered throughout the book. It added a layer of complexity to her character, and I could not help but root for her throughout the story.<br/><br/>While the ending of the book was slightly disappointing, it did not detract from the overall quality of the book. In fact, the cliffhanger has left me eagerly anticipating the next instalment in the series. Overall, I highly recommend Painted Devils to anyone looking for a captivating and enjoyable read.",,,1,0

Her younger sister, Mallika, persuades Eila to attend Rosewood, a place where they can land roles in a popular regency-detective show. The book is a joyful romance filled with wit and humor that will keep you entertained from start to finish. The author has done an excellent job of crafting unique personalities for each character, and their goofiness is so charming that you will fall in love with all of them. Mallika's dramatics are a joy to read, and 'Wallika' is definitely something that will make you laugh. The romance between Eila and Rahul is swoon-worthy, and the Shakespearean and Austen quotes sprinkled throughout the book add an extra layer of depth to the story. In fact, the book is so well-written that it made me wish that I had read the works of these literary giants before.<br/><br/>One of the most remarkable things about Rosewood is the sibling relationship portrayed in the book. Eila and Mallika's bond is heartwarming and a breath of fresh air. This aspect of the book is something that readers will appreciate, especially if they are looking for representations of positive sibling relationship. <br/><br/>The pacing of the book is excellent, and I breezed through the pages in just a few hours. It is a perfect read for those who are looking for a young adult version of Bridgerton, but with much more fun and diverse characters.

Gabriel Utterson, a 17-year-old law clerk, has returned to London for the first time since his life— and that of his dearest friend, Henry Jekyll—was derailed by a scandal that led to his and Henry's expulsion from the London Medical School. People have been gossiping about their relationship, but Gabriel wants to start anew with Henry. However, Henry has become distant and stopped writing to Gabriel. To find out what happened, Gabriel watches the Jekyll house and meets Hyde, an enigmatic young man who claims to be Henry's friend. As Henry continues to ignore Gabriel, Gabriel becomes jealous of Hyde's closeness to him. But there is more to the story, with monsters lurking in London. Kalynn has a talent for writing compelling characters, and this book is just as brilliant as her previous works. I love retellings, and this was such a great take on the original story with a lot of angst and mystery. It was heartbreaking to see Henry hurting and the injustices he faces daily for being a Black and queer person. I was very intrigued by Hyde and was left guessing about his true nature. This was a solid read that I would definitely recommend to readers who love retellings with a gothic twist.<br/><br/>tw // sexual assault, homophobia, racism<br/><br/>Thank you to @hearourvoicestours and @macmillanusa for providing me with the finished copy.",,,1,0

She has always tried to fit in and hopes that if she's straight enough, Vietnamese enough, and American enough, she can get the college money he promised. But the house has other plans. Every night, she has sleep paralysis, dead bugs everywhere, rot, and the ghost of a beautiful bride. Worst of all, her Ba doesn't believe her, so with the help of Florence, the niece of her dad's business partner, she sets out to discover the truth. This has a slow-burning tension with several creepy moments and the perfect atmosphere for a horror story. The writing is so poetic, and it perfectly contrasts the horror elements in it. Trang Thanh Tran reminds us that a haunted house is not just about ghosts but that its history plays a very huge role. Tran did a very beautiful job in weaving the gothic elements with the long reach of colonialism. I loved the lyrical writing and how the author handled JAde grappling with her identity as a bisexual, Vietnamese-American. This is definitely the perfect read for the fans of Mexican Gothic.<br/><br/><i>tws // internalized biphobia, body horror, systemic/interpersonal racism, colonialism, death of a parent, depiction of hanging, mention of domestic abuse, murder<br/><br/>Thank you to Bloomsbury Publishing for providing me with an advanced copy in exchange for an honest review. </i>",,,1,0

The story is told through Redford Kenny's POV, and she is an unpredictable character. Despite the promising theme, I felt this story lacked the uniqueness that you find in Holly's debut series. This is a very plot-heavy story that doesn't give you the chance to get to know the characters. The secrets were given a lot of build-up but ended up being very predictable. The characters fell flat, and most of them didn't have a strong presence. The ending felt very rushed and left me unsatisfied. I would not recommend readers pick this up if they are new to this author's works.",,,1,0

It was such a sweet and refreshing story with loveable characters. Zahra was a strong and relatable heroine with a group of friends that I would love to have. I loved the peek into the Bangladeshi culture and could honestly keep reading more. The main highlight was the romance. It had fake dating, secret romance, and love triangle. I was rooting for both the love interests, Harun and Nayim. They were both sweet with their unique quirks. Add in, the meddling aunties, and 'well-meaning' uncles . It had all the drama, pining, and strong relationships that I wished for. The sucker that I am for a drama, I wished to see a more dramatic ending but didn't feel too bad about it. I would definitely recommend this book if you are looking for a YA romcom with an adorable cast of characters.",,,1,0

Along this journey, I loved seeing her coming to terms with her ignorance and blind trust in the history of her kingdom Qalia. The other main leads, Taha and Qayn were interesting and I definitely would like to read from their POVs. Despite having great potential for complex characters, the other characters felt one-dimensional. The romance in the story was anything but enemies to lovers. It felt more like a lot of misunderstandings and insta love. I liked the concept of Imani letting go of her inherent bias and fighting for justice. A lot of the time, her actions felt impulsive with no strong motive. I hope to read more about the magic system and see the depths of Taha and Qayn's characters. ",,,1,0

Tensions are running high in Shanghai with the Nationalists, Communists, and the Imperialists vying for control and each having an agenda of their own. Each faction has its own spies and assassins planted among the others that no one's loyalty is certain. We meet many familiar faces and mainly follow Rosalind Lang aka Lady Fortune, an assassin for the Nationalists and Orion Hong, a Nationalist spy. Rosalind and Orion are assigned a mission to go undercover as a married couple to root out the reason behind a string of murders committed using a chemical weapon. Chloe Gong is a talented writer and keeps you hooked on the story with its politics and murder mystery. The beginning of the story was quite slow but I grew to enjoy it. As with her previous books, my main complaint was how one-dimensional the characters were. We mostly get to know them on the surface level and it makes it hard to care for them. I mostly enjoyed reading from Phoebe Hong and Celia's POV as she proved to be interesting. Despite the slow start to the story, but last half of twists and turns made up for it. There were a lot of things to love in this story. It has queer rep, spy stuff, secret government missions, and lots of banter.  As for the romance, I preferred that of Celia and Oliver. I loved reading more about Celia Lang and I'm eager to read the sequel for more of her. This new duology has an engaging plot and a lot of action-packed scenes that might appeal to readers more than These Violent Delights. ",,,1,0

It starts over a year after the first book's events where Malini and Priya are on separate paths to reclaim what is theirs. But things are not as easy as they seem. Though Malini has gained allies, their allyship is tenuous at best and already showing cracks. Meanwhile, Priya is not yet aware of the truth of her magic and dreams to rid Ahiranya of the rot that plagues it and the oppressive empire that has ruined her country. I loved Malini in the first book but in this, we get to see her many facets which I swiftly grew to admire. Her will to defy the world hellbent on oppressing her and would love to see her burn was admirable. Priya's conflict between her love and duty for her people and her passion for Malini was so heart-wrenching. I was neutral towards Aditya in the beginning, but he was someone who possesses a gentle but commanding presence. Getting a glimpse into Chandra's mind and his 'faithfulness' was eye-opening and filled me with fury. One of the things that I completely loved in this is how Tasha portrays the complexities of relationships, especially in families. The history of the Yaksa and the Mothers of the Flame is slowly unravelled and was so interesting. This book was slow, but it is meant to be savoured and you would appreciate how each detail is tied to reveal the bigger picture. I assure you, you would be filled with many emotions by the end, both joyous and heartbreaking. I hope I successfully convinced you to pick up this series because this is one such series that I would go back to multiple times.",,,1,0

Tucker has woven mystery, political intrigue, and a mystical world with a brutal history. After chaos arises at the end of the first book, Romeria and Zander aim to the Venhorn Mountains, despite their dubiousness of the prophecy. They are accompanied by their closest friends and allies whose motives remain unclear. Meantime, the relationship between Romy and Zander grows complicated. Throw in the secrets they both harbor from their allies and a bounty on their heads. We get Zander's POV in this book, which I appreciated as I gained a more intimate understanding. Many new characters are introduced in this book, and I loved witnessing how the mystery was unraveled slowly. Like most of the sequels, I did feel this dragged a bit but I didn't mind it much. The constant sense of danger that they are in was portrayed very effectively. One of the characters that I loved was Jarek. I like the distrustful and broody characters. I am incredibly excited to devour the following book and learn more about the Fates, Nymphs, and their powers. This is an excellent blend of political intrigue, mystery, and magic that leaves you craving for more.",,,1,0

Their love hate relationship is not one we come across often. It was refreshing. I poured through the book in a matter of hours as the writing was easy and engaging. I did wish to see more of the world and character growth but it was a well written fantasy that would make you crave for more.

I was impressed how seamlessly the histories of the jinn and humans were interwoven with stories. This was definitely an interesting take on One Thousand and One Nights, which was my favourite while growing up. We dive right into the quest for a long lost and powerful relic of a jinn king. I loved learning about the stories of jinn. Despite the strong plot, I couldn't help but feel that none of the characters particularly stand out. We are given just a hint of their background but never really get to know them. The only character relationship that I really liked was  that of Qadir and Loulie. Mazen and Aisha were intriguing and I can't wait to know more about them in the sequel. Another thing that I loved about this book is that there was no romance. It was refreshing to see people with conflicting opinions on a quest without romance at the forefront. Sometimes I just want to read about characters that are enemies become friends. This certainly delivers it. I would definitely recommend this book if you are looking for a plot driven fantasy that is filled with stories and adventures.",,,1,0

It had all the fairytale vibes and simple writing that I fell in love with earlier. I was immersed in the story and loved reentering this world. Despite its promising writing, the plot often felt messy and disconnected with little to no character development except for Shiori. I understand that she is the main character but the remaining characters fell flat especially Takkan whose sole purpose was to be the love interest. The beginning felt very drawn out and chaotic but the story picked up paced afterwards. I grew increasingly curious about Raikama and would love to know more about her past. Some new characters were introduced but I felt like they didn't serve any big purpose and felt redundant to the story. The whole plotline felt rushed and I wished it could have been fleshed out better. Despite the story being weaker than the first one, I still enjoyed every second of it and would definitely recommend this duology.",,,1,0

I loved Pretty Woman and couldn't wait to read the story of Violet and Cain. This was a cute story with a prospect for banter and forced proximity. But I was disappointed with the fact that this was too short a story and didn't explore the characters. Cain was my least favourite character who was a big asshole who thinks pink is for girls. The romance between Violet and Cain was dull and not at all what I was imagining. Throughout the story, all characters were pretty much cardboard cutouts with no depth. The overall story was fun but at the end of the day, it wasn't a memorable rom-com. I would recommend this if you are looking for a meaningless read to stave off your boredom.  ",,,1,0

The main concept of the story and the lyrical writing were the only plus points of the book. It has strong fairytale vibes, with a main character who is your generic self-sacrificing YA heroine. My main gripe was about the poorly written characters. I felt like I was watching the story through a lens. I found it beautiful but couldn't connect to it emotionally. The beginning starts by abruptly jumping onto the core of the story. We don't see the motivations and strong beliefs but are rather told that they are the reasons for the Mina's actions. Added to that, the romance appears out of nowhere. There was no indication when it began but confessions of love are thrown in, which I found unreal. I found great potential in the bonds formed between the side characters and Mina but they were weakly written. The plot was interesting but the weak characterization led to a poor execution of the story. <br/>If you are looking to read a book just for the vibes and is inspired by Korean mythology, this might be for you.",,,1,0

A fantasy story inspired by the Chinese legend of the moon goddess, we are told a tale lush with magic, quests and forbidden romance. Xingyin, the daughter of the moon goddess, has to navigate the deadly court of the Celestial Kingdom, learn and master her magic and combat skills, all the while looking for a way to free her mother from exile and keeping her identity a secret. I loved her transition from a naive and oblivious young girl to a fierce and brave woman. I am not a fan of love triangles but Liwei and Wenzhi are the exceptions. I liked how we get to know each of them and how they burrow into Xingyin's heart. Both had their faults but were charming and intriguing at the same time. The romance was very natural without feeling forced and left me conflicted about whom I ship more. I was entranced by the magic system and the fearsome challenges faced by Xingyin. I binge read the whole book in just a couple of hours. It was so addicting with a perfect blend of romance and fantasy. <br/>This has <br/>- secret identities<br/>- enemies to lovers/forbidden romance<br/>- magical quests<br/>- love triangles<br/>- myths, legends, and of course dragons<br/>If you love any of these tropes, you would absolutely enjoy it.",,,1,0

There were several time jumps that prevented me from connecting with the characters. The whole story was like the plot of a seven season show crammed into one. Whenever I started to get invested, there were massive time jumps. We were told the events that happened and how the motivations of the characters shifted or evolved but we don't see them happen.

It has some of my favourite tropes — Princess brings back the magic, quest, dysfunctional siblings, secret societies and was inspired by ancient India. I was also excited to read a book written by a South Indian and clearly saw many references that I absolutely loved. Sadly, the characters and the storyline fell flat for me. The beginning of the story started off very weak with the characters motivation falling flat. I expected a lot of tension among the siblings but what I got was a watered down version of it. Throughout the story, all conflicts were resolved so easily that I was left disappointed. The actual quest started later in the book and it was achieved so easily. This was supposed to be a quest for an ancient secret that was hidden with painstaking difficulties but they succeeded it just like that. The twist at the end came as a surprise but I didn't care for any of it at that point. The sequel might be good but I'm not sure I'll read it. All in all, it was a really good inspiration of ancient India and has a diverse set of characters but falls short in delivering the tension filled quest I was promised.",,,1,0

There was a scene where she said NO and he straight up ignored and we are supposed to find it sexy. I'm tired of reading romance novels where dubious consent is glorified as romance.

This had the potential to explore the deep seated racism and homophobia and several factors. The world built was confusing till the end, with no proper explanation given. The characters and their mannerisms were forced and their interactions often felt unnatural. The romance is kind of insta love but it was more like a badly written historical romance. The plot twists and the motivations of the villains were underwhelming and everything just happened in a click without any apparent difficulty. The only thing that I liked was the folktales at the beginning of the chapters. I'm deeply disappointed as I had high expectations after reading the blurb. Wouldn't recommend this at all.",,,1,0

She is spending time with her grandmother in London and has a date with a cute boy, Nick. But things don't go quite as well as she hoped. She is struck with the terrible reality where she is a monster and the boy she is attracted to is a legendary monster slayer. A new alliance with Aaron Oliver, she runs in search for answers and understand this terrible and enchanting power she possesses. This story was surprisingly engaging with never a boring moment. A naive girl in the beginning, Joan becomes jaded with events that unfold. At times, I was quite frustrated with her impulsive decisions but I liked the character growth. The monster powers were intriguing but I hope to see more in the next books. It has some of the standard tropes like coming into new powers, star-crossed love but the main character being the monster in the story made it all the more interesting. I don't quite ship the main relationship as I always tend to like the dark haired love interest.   There were a lot of questions that I want to be answered by the end of the book. Luckily this is a series, so I hope to get more knowledge about the fantasy elements. You wouldn't want to miss this exciting urban fantasy.",,,1,0

I liked how the author dealt with the characters emotional trauma. I couldn't get enough of Wren and Lei. Their character development throughout the trilogy was very well done. It surprised me how much I grew to like Blue, whom I despised in the beginning. However, I felt indifferent towards the struggles in this book.

At times, I felt this story was dragging and this series could be ended as a duology. The main character was so dumb with no purpose other than to move along the story. Honestly she felt unnecessary to the story. And there were several instances where the abuse and emotional manipulation was brushed off as nothing. It could have been handled better. The writing is what turned me off. The use of modern language in this setting made the world and story less interesting. Overall this was such a bland book with unsurprising plot twists.",,,1,0

Though this is marketed as a love story, the romance aspect was sorely lacking. The past of Roma and Juliette was hinted at several times but we never get the full glimpse and thus made the angst and love superficial. That said, I enjoyed learning about Communism and increasing influence of the West in the East. Juliette's struggle in never quite fitting in and her motivations were very well portrayed. My favourite relationship was that of Benedikt and Marshall. Roma, as a character, felt unremarkable. The monster aspect of this was intriguing but the final reveal was underwhelming.

Throughout the book, I was eager to know what happens next. This is a slow build-up suspense story that ends in an unexpected way. I was not sure what happened at the end but got a clear picture after reading the afterword. As for the heroine, I'm not a fan of her. She's a naive, over imaginative, and boring character that I've ever encountered. I was wondering if I should just dnf this book for over 50% of the story. But, I'm happy that I decided against it. I can't describe this as an edge of the seat, psychological thriller but a mix of these. It's been an interesting read. I would recommend it to readers who enjoy a good suspense story and suggest them not to leave it halfway even though it's quite slow for most of the time.",,,1,0

This is a very character driven story that takes us through the grief, the confusion and the courage it takes to deal when life gives you a hard blow. Eileen Cotton is a lovable character and was my favorite in the story. <br/><br/>The audiobook is narrated by Alison Steadman and Daisy Edgar-Jones. They did a splendid job in portraying the character's emotions accurately. But, this in itself felt as a drawback for me as I'm a fast reader. Those who enjoy audiobooks would definitely like this one. It's just not for me.<br/><br/>As for the plot, it was engaging, fun, sweet, and a heart-warming story with witty humor. The initial few chapters were a bit of a drag but the story picks the pace afterwards. Enjoyed getting to know Eileen, Leena, Marian, Arnold, Betsy, Bee, Fitz and the reclusive Letitia. I would definitely recommend it to readers who want a quick, fun read.",,,1,0

This is the first book that I've read of Adrienne Young. I must say, she is a brilliant author. Her writing style, the story setting, and the characters are very engaging. <br/><br/>Fable, a young girl of 14 years was abandoned by her infamous pirate father on the island of Jeval, which was filled with thieves with no scruples. For four years, she has been scrounging for every last bit of copper to earn passage on a ship to leave to Ceros. I liked that Fable made the best out of worst situation with grim determination. Due to an unforeseen incident, she has to leave the island early. She gets passage on West's ship, who used to buy the pyre she dredged for the past two years.<br/><br/>Most of the story is set on the high seas where the characters have to weather the storms and stay alive to reach their destination. It was full of smuggling, trading, betrayals and in short a harsh world with tough rules.  Though the story was unique, with likable characters I found it difficult to love. The writing was addictive, so I could move forward but I found many aspects that troubled me as a reader.<br/><br/>The first thing was, there was no map depicting the world and the places mentioned. I found it little difficult to imagine. And second, this is my first book where the whole story was set in the high seas and boats. I'm not familiar with all the terminology regarding sailing so I found it little uninteresting. And I would have loved to read a more about the Trade council and the workings.<br/><br/>Lastly, I wish this book was a bit longer so it wouldn't have finished sooner :( . I was able to finish this book in  just 5 hrs, it was <i>that</i> good. Overall, it was a good read but I didn't love it. I will definitely read her other books many have raved about. Can't wait to have the second book of this series to know how the story progresses. Hoping for a little bit <i>more</i> in every aspect in the next book.",,,1,0

Of course, the cover was gorgeous. I had lot of expectations before starting this, but the story fell flat. The book starts with Thea being barred from the laboratory where her mother Marguerite Hope and she worked in creating 'The Philosopher's Stone'. <br/><br/>Recently, she has been exhibiting a wildness and sickness that was unnatural. Her treatment of Thea was harsh, filled with suspicion. At the final stage of the experiment, in a fit of violent temper, her mother attempts to kill her and destroys the stone. Later, Thea flees  to England due to the mounting political tensions in Normandy to stay with her unknown father. She has the steps to be performed in the last stage of creating the Philosopher's stone in her possession. The whole story deals with Thea's desire to create the stone and various people who would stoop to any level to gain the power that it grants them. <br/><br/>Everything was going well for me, except for the slight dislike I had for the main character. I was hoping that would not be the case going forward. Though the story, and the fantasy world it was set in were good, I didn't enjoy it mostly because of the lead character. Her arrogance, and contempt towards others was always at the forefront of her mind. Her blind devotion to Will, and illogical excuses to save people were annoying to say the least.<br/><br/>Till about 85% of the story you see her being greedy for the power that the stone would offer her. Saving her mother, Dominic and Will were just those pesky things she had to do just to show that she cared. But I didn't get the sense that she actually cared for them. Even at the end of the story I didn't feel that there was any character development in her.<br/><br/>It lacked the mystery and action I was hoping for and the whole story felt dull, repetitive and unimpressive at the end. Overall, the plus points were the author's writing and the cover. The story had promise which it failed to fulfill.",,,1,0

Reed. The storyline was unique and hooked me from the beginning. The world building was good. Though I have to wait for the next book to understand more about this world and how and why everyone came into this game and what what is their purpose other than winning. If they win, what would happen. My only complaint was that the MC's interaction was limited to Zak throughout the book and very little with anyone else. Also, at the beginning I felt annoyed with her know-it-all attitude but she has grown on me by the end. It was a fast-paced story with lot of action and realistic characters. Overall an enjoyable read.<br/>Thanks, J. E. Reed for this lovely book ",true,,1,0
